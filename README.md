My first repository on GitHub!

Hello! My name is Nyx Midnight. Please be patient with me as I am learning version control and GitHub. Thank you in advance!

I use HTML, CSS and a sprinkling of PHP to write websites. My main strength is in translation. I can translate text from English to French (Canada) and from French to English (Canada).
