hello-world
===========

My very first repository on GitHub!

Hello! My name is Nyx, formerly Nyx Midnight. Please be patient with me as I am learning version control and GitHub. Thank you in advance!

I use HTML, CSS and a sprinkling of PHP to write fan websites. My main strength are translation and copywriting. I can translate text from English to French (Canada) and from French to English (Canada).

I am a big fan of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)!
